# Test Suite

This folder contains a series of acceptance tests that verify the behavior
of the programs is preserved. 

Some of these tests have obvious outputs (such as `hello_world.t`). There is
also a test suite in `problems_99.t` that attempts to pass all of the solutions
taken from [OCaml's 99 Problems
page](https://ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/99problems.html). Not all problems were
solved, so not all problems appear in the test suite.
