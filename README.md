Caramel is a functional language for building type-safe, scalable, and
maintainable applications.

Caramel leverages:

* the OCaml type-system, to provide you with industrial-strength type safety

* the Erlang VM, known for running low-latency, distributed, and fault-tolerant
  systems used in a wide range of industries.
